# Proud Achievements

Creating a learning journey tailored to Scotstoun Primary School students’ needs was a challenging task, but the team's commitment and ingenuity led to numerous significant accomplishments. The following is a reflection of the proud achievements that the Grove Quest project team has made throughout its development journey:

** Collaborative Teamwork **: Successfully merging two separate project teams and fostering a culture of collaboration instead of competition is an achievement worth celebrating. By working together, we were able to combine our expertise to design an enriching learning journey.

** Robust Ideation Process **: Our team used the value vs. complexity framework to brainstorm and pinpoint optimal project concepts. Our decision to focus on a scavenger hunt game theme – Grove Quest – highlights our ability to create an engaging, interactive experience with a balance between educational value and technical feasibility.

** Inclusive Game Design **: We designed mini-games that not only cater to the primary school students' varying abilities but also consider the needs of students with physical/mental disabilities. This commitment to inclusivity is a vital achievement in our design process.

** Responsive Development **: We adapted to client feedback quickly, tailoring our games to be more appealing and appropriate for children. This responsiveness demonstrates our commitment to meeting our client's needs and creating a product that resonates with its target audience.

** Prototyping & Usability Testing **: Our iterative design approach, which included the creation of paper prototypes and high-fidelity digital prototypes, and usability testing with a group of 30 students, showed our dedication to refining our designs based on real user feedback.

** Successful Survey Results **: Our survey results validated the effectiveness of our Grove Quest. The majority of the students found the game to be effective in encouraging learning and interactive exploration of Fossil Grove. The game elements - Trivia questions, Image Chase activity, and Match Mystery games - were rated as being easy to understand and fun to interact with.

** Final Product – Grove Quest **: The culmination of our efforts, Grove Quest, is an achievement we are immensely proud of. This AR platformer game promotes interactive learning and exploration, while also providing an enriching and memorable experience for students visiting Fossil Grove.

The Grove Quest project is a testament to our team's ability to work collaboratively, respond to client needs, and create an engaging, inclusive, and educational product. We are immensely proud of what we have accomplished and are excited about the potential impact this project will have on enhancing students' learning experiences at Fossil Grove.
