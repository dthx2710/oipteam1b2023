# Usability Tests

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
<span
style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '15px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.12em 0.4em 0.12em 0.4em',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}>
{children}
</span>
);


The group assembled 30 students, all around 22 years old, to test Grove Quest. They were tasked with engaging in different mini-games provided, with the objective of <Highlight color="#11a281">evaluating their understanding</Highlight> of each game and to determine their <Highlight color="#11a281">satisfaction</Highlight> with Grove Quest.

It would be more beneficial if we could recruit students from the targeted user age group for a more precise evaluation and insights. Nonetheless, the outcomes of these trials still provided valuable information.
