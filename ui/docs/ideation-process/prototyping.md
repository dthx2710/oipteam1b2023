# Prototyping

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
<span
style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '15px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.12em 0.4em 0.12em 0.4em',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}>
{children}
</span>
);

Our proposal for Grove Quest has received approval from our clients. They offered us some guidance for further development:

- Ensure that all mini-games are <Highlight color="#11a281">simple enough for students</Highlight> to complete.
- Consider the needs of <Highlight color="#11a281">students with physical/mental disabilities</Highlight>.
- Have more variety in Match Mystery, moving beyond matching the image and the labels.

## Development of the mini-games

During the fruitful trip to Fossil Grove, the team identified 4 key areas to function as the stations for Grove Quest:

1. Statue of the tree
2. Inside the Fossil House
3. Path leading to the Fossil
4. The Quarry area

The trip also played a crucial role in assisting our team to create more targeted content for the mini-games.

## Paper prototypes

![Paper Prototypes Image](../../static/img/ideation/paper_prototype.png)

Paper prototypes were created to emulate the game experience during the trip. These paper prototypes serves two purposes:

- To generate new variations of Match Mystery
- To enable <Highlight color="#11a281">swift prototyping</Highlight> by the team, to create a inclusive design for the students

## Feedback

We submitted the paper prototypes, along with the mini-game questions and activities, to our clients for their review. They provided the following feedback:

- The games should be tailored to be more appealing and appropriate for children.
- Accommodations should be made to <Highlight color="#11a281">support students with disabilities</Highlight> e.g. dyslexic students.
- <Highlight color="#11a281">More visual aids/cues</Highlight> could be used to help the student navigate easily.
- The games should foster learning in a manner that discourages guessing.

The following images are examples of the two iterations of Trivia Hunt questions which we changed along the way, with the help of David from Fossil Grove.

## Figma

Considering the feedback received, we refined our designs and created a high-fidelity prototype incorporating the following adjustments:

- The mini-games have been designed to be solvable by primary school students of varying abilities
- The <Highlight color="#11a281">layout of the mini-games has been improved</Highlight> to present the content more effectively
- The <Highlight color="#11a281">complexity of the language</Highlight> used has been <Highlight color="#11a281">reduced</Highlight> to enhance understandability.
- <Highlight color="#11a281">More visuals and cues</Highlight> were added to guide gameplay.
