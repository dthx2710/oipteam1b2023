Fossil Grove is a unique earth heritage site with 330 million years old fossil tree stumps. Due to its geological importance, the site is used to teach University students and keen visitors. As such, educational content were designed and implemented for adult learners.

Scotstoun Primary is a school with students of age ranging from 6 to 11 years. Despite the close promixity of the school to Fossil Grove, there was not any activities or content targetted for the primary school students.

## The Problem

Designing educational content for primary school students presents a different set of criterions, namely:

- Designing child-friendly content: The main challenge is making complex geological concepts understandable and interesting for primary school students. The activites created must suitable for their cognitive and developmental level.

- Keeping the children engaged: The attention span of young children can be relatively short. The activities must be engaging and interactive yet not too long to maintain the children's interest.

- Managable for teachers: The activities should be straightforward and uncomplicated, allowing any teacher to carry them out without requiring extensive expertise. The safety of the activities should also be ensured to minimize the risk of accidents

- Sustainability: The initiative should ideally be sustainable. It's not just about creating a one-time activity, but rather a repeatable experience that can be improved over time and possibly expanded to other schools or age groups.
