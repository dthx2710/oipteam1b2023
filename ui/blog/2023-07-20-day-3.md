Today we received feedback from our client about our initial collaboration idea. They've suggested we provide more detailed information regarding our "Amazing Race" concept.

In response, we convened a meeting to discuss our progress, create an implementation plan, and layout the framework for our pitch video.

Our frontend team has been researching Three.js, a JavaScript library that enables us to create and display 3D graphics. Meanwhile, our gamemasters have been brainstorming a variety of games and puzzles to be included in the "Amazing Race". We're still planning the overall flow and refining our pitch.

For the backend, we've decided to share a single database (Firebase) with Team A. This will ensure a seamless flow of state and information between the teams. By tonight, we will decide on whether to use Node.js or Golang for our server.
