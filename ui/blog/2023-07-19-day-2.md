### Class

The day began with a lecture on the Feedback Mindset, a crucial aspect in our ongoing project. We also submitted our Github usernames for seamless collaboration on the project platform.

### Project

Unfortunately, our clients had to reschedule our meeting to next Tuesday, 25th July. We're currently considering the possibility of having a Zoom meeting in the evenings this week.

We also had a joint meeting with Team 1A. Our objective was to plan a distinct and enriching experience related to our problem statement, making sure there's no overlap between the tasks of the two teams. We're focusing on collaboration over competition. It was decided that Team A will handle the learning experience before and after the fossil grove visit, while Team B, our team, will take charge of the learning experience during the visit.

Our internal meeting allowed us to brainstorm innovative ideas to make the fossil grove visit engaging, even considering gamification of the experience. We narrowed down the ideas to an Amazing Race or Treasure Hunt style activity, likely a fusion of the two. We brainstormed steps on how to implement this idea and assigned roles and responsibilities for implementation.

We also updated our clients via email about our collaboration idea.

Tentative Roles & Responsibilities:

| Member    | Role                    |
