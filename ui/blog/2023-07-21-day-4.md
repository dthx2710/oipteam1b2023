### Class

Today, we delved into the concept of prototyping. We drew our prototype idea on paper to visualize our plan better. It was a productive exercise as it helped us refine our concept. Additionally, we shared our prototype idea with the Curio Robot team, providing us with an opportunity to receive feedback and suggestions.

### Project

We had a discussion with Professor Grizou concerning the email on our choice of backend/database implementation. These conversations are crucial in making informed decisions about the technology stack we use.

We also recorded our Week 1 pitch video to summarize our progress and to share our future plans. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gogf-5Qy81s&ab_channel=dthx2710).

Moving forward, we held discussions about our plans, focusing on refining our prototype and ensuring our technology decisions align with our project goals.
